For [Episode 21 of Scatter Podcast](https://soundcloud.com/scatterpodcast/episode-021), I had a great discussion with Ben Taylor, the Co-Founder and Chief AI Officer at Zeff.

Ben is a wealth of knowledge about data science, artificial intelligence, and careers in these fields.

I had a great time with him and we cover a lot including one of Ben's recent, jaw-dropping side projects that is in development: A trained, AI-powered Call of Duty player that battles humans over Xbox Live!

Ben shares so many great tips and resources around data science careers... Hiring complexities, finding balance between work and family life, motivation and perseverance, the benefit of data science conferences... Lots of great takeaways for students and practitioners alike. Enjoy the show!
