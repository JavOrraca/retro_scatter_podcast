For [Episode 17 of Scatter Podcast](https://soundcloud.com/scatterpodcast/episode-017), I interviewed [Justin Fortier](https://www.linkedin.com/in/justin-fortier-4563554/), Principal Data Scientist at ViralGains.

Justin and I met at the 2018 Data Science GO conference and I wanted to share his data science journey.

ViralGains is a video advertising technology startup that helps publishers push video ad content to the most appropriate consumers. Given that ViralGains operates within the real-time bidding ("RTB") domain, their ad bidding and classification algorithms need to transact and process within 100 milliseconds. Justin explains the classification models that he relies on, he provides an overview of RTB, and he discusses AdTech concerns around fraud. It was a pleasure to have him on the show. Keep up with his conference presentations and podcast appearances by following him on LinkedIn and enjoy the episode!
