Scatter Podcast is an analytics and data science podcast that launched in 2019. The hosts of the show, [Javier Orraca](https://www.javierorraca.com/) and [Joel Dayrit](http://jfdayrit.com/), met in graduate school in 2018 while enrolled in University of California, Irvine's [Masters in Business Analytics](https://merage.uci.edu/programs/masters/master-science-business-analytics/index.html) program. The hosts of Scatter Podcast interview data science thought leaders and practitioners to discuss careers and new technologies in analytics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and all things data science.

We are proud to host a career column by Scatter Podcast guest and now teammate, [Jonathan Tesser](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-tesser-a2a1852/), VP of Research, Insights and Analytics at NYC & Company. Jon has over 15 years of experience using data to learn about consumers and applying those insights to drive key business objectives. Jon was one of the first Scatter Podcast guests (re: [Episode 4 w/ NYC & Co's Jon Tesser](https://soundcloud.com/scatterpodcast/episode-004)) in 2019 and has written dozens of editorials featured on Medium and LinkedIn's career feed. He is a passionate advocate for bringing the power of self awareness to the job search for early career professionals and has a goal of making you think differently.
